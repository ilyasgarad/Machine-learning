##Next Word Prediction Model with LSTM

This project demonstrates the use of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for predicting the next word in a given sentence or phrase. It uses an LSTM-based neural network trained on a dataset of text to predict the next word based on the input provided by the user.

##Overview

The model takes an input sentence or phrase and predicts the next most likely word. The model is based on an LSTM architecture, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known for its ability to learn from sequential data. The text input is tokenized, and the LSTM model predicts the next word based on this sequence.
