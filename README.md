# Iris Species Prediction App

This Streamlit application predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its physical features: **sepal length**, **sepal width**, **petal length**, and **petal width**. The app uses a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on the famous **Iris dataset**.

## Features

- **Interactive Sliders**: Adjust sliders to input flower measurements dynamically.
- **Prediction Output**: Displays the predicted species with a simple interface.
- **Iris Dataset Overview**: Provides details about the dataset for educational purposes.
- **Dataset Viewer**: Option to view a sample of the Iris dataset.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web application.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For the machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier).

## Dataset

The **Iris dataset** contains 150 records, each with:
- **Sepal Length (cm)**
- **Sepal Width (cm)**
- **Petal Length (cm)**
- **Petal Width (cm)**
- **Species**: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.
